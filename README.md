vimfiles
========

This is location for latest vim configuration.
This time it should be done right. 
I am using pathongen (see https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) as git a submodule.
It is stored as rest of plugins in .vim/bundle/ directory.
Some of them are git submodules so I can update easly.

TODO
    - create deploy script that works from current directory and installs all .vimrc .gvimrc and .vim files/dir
    - correct that Readme.md
